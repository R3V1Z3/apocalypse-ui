# Apocalypse UI

While madness overtook the world, ATOM sat idly awaiting the opportunity to again serve its human user's needs. That opportunity never came.

Many angry organic forms found their way to the lonely computer only to express the insanity of their disease. Some thrashed body parts at it. Others decorated it with lower lifeforms. One managed to crack its main display.

Once a pristine terminal, ATOM now sits adorned with unrecognizable shreds of former life awaiting the impending darkness.

## Enter the Apocalypse

Join ATOM at the end of everything. Apocalypse UI lets you code like all life once depended on it. It's too late now, but you can still work on algorithms that maybe could have saved humanity.

## Turn back the clock on the Apocalypse
The apocalyptic mess can make it impossible to code. So the "Pre apocalypse" option in the settings lets you return ATOM to its former glory; unstained, no cracked screens. Makes it easier to code, but tougher to code like all life once depended on it.

## Features
- Based on Atom One Dark UI so it grabs and uses colors from the selected syntax theme.
- Made for dark syntax themes but works okay when themes have "light" keyword at the end (ex. Solarized Light).

## Known Issues
- Editor display is cracked, needs repeair.
- All displays are old and blurry, need repair.
- Blood stain blocks top portion of tree-view, needs cleaning.
- Organic matter splattered everywhere, simply disgusting.
